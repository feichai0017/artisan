//! One checkpoint round — the planner's main work unit, also
//! invoked synchronously by `Checkpointer::Drop` to drain in-flight
//! dirty state before the Tree handle disappears.
//!
//! ## Sequence
//!
//! 0. **Merge pass** (optional, controlled by
//!    `CheckpointConfig::auto_merge`) — drains queued parent-merge
//!    candidates and folds mergeable children back into parents.
//!    Merge mutations are staged through the same dirty /
//!    pending-delete sets as foreground writes, then flushed by
//!    this round after the WAL sync.
//! 1. **Snapshot dirty + pending deletes** under the exclusive
//!    side of the tree's commit-publish gate.
//! 2. **Flush WAL** through the journal worker so every record that
//!    mirrors a snapshotted seq is durable before we drop it.
//! 3. **Clone snapshotted bytes** while still holding the same
//!    commit-publish gate, then enqueue one checkpoint epoch to
//!    the I/O worker.
//! 4. **Retire completed epochs** on later planner turns in FIFO
//!    order. This is the truncate watermark: a later epoch may not
//!    advance WAL trimming before every older epoch is known to
//!    have landed or restored.
//! 5. **Truncate WAL** only when the pipeline is empty and
//!    `bm.dirty_count() == 0 && bm.pending_delete_count() == 0`
//!    under the commit-publish gate.
//!
//! This function is called from two places:
//!
//! - The `checkpoint_thread` main loop in [`super::mod`]
//!   (background path).
//! - `Checkpointer::Drop` (synchronous final round on the calling
//!   thread, after the planner has joined and writers are
//!   guaranteed to be gone).
