//! One checkpoint round — the planner's main work unit, also
//! invoked synchronously by `Checkpointer::Drop` to drain in-flight
//! dirty state before the Tree handle disappears.
//!
//! ## Sequence
//!
//! 0. **Merge pass** (optional, controlled by
//!    `CheckpointConfig::auto_merge`) — drains queued parent-merge
//!    candidates and folds mergeable children back into parents.
//!    Merge mutations are staged through the same dirty /
//!    pending-delete sets as foreground writes, then flushed by
//!    this round after the WAL sync.
//! 1. **Snapshot dirty + pending deletes** under the exclusive
//!    side of the tree's commit-publish gate.
//! 2. **Flush WAL** through the journal worker so every record that
//!    mirrors a snapshotted seq is durable before we drop it.
//! 3. **Clone snapshotted bytes** while still holding the same
//!    commit-publish gate, then submit one
//!    `IoTask::FlushBatchAndSync`.
//! 4. **Collect completion** — wait for the one-shot completion.
//!    On write failure, restore the whole dirty snapshot via
//!    `bm.restore_dirty` because a store batch may have written
//!    an arbitrary prefix. On sync failure, keep dirty retirement
//!    decisions but leave pending deletes / WAL truncation blocked.
//! 5. **Pre-delete Sync** — normally completed inside
//!    `FlushBatchAndSync`; rounds with no dirty blob batch still
//!    send one standalone `IoTask::Sync`.
//! 6. **Truncate WAL** — only when (a) no `Flush` failed AND (b)
//!    `bm.dirty_count() == 0` checked under the commit-publish
//!    gate. The interlock with the writer-side dirty/journal
//!    publish order ensures we never drop a record whose effect
//!    isn't already in store.
//!
//! This function is called from two places:
//!
//! - The `checkpoint_thread` main loop in [`super::mod`]
//!   (background path).
//! - `Checkpointer::Drop` (synchronous final round on the calling
//!   thread, after the planner has joined and writers are
//!   guaranteed to be gone).
