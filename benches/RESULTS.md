# holt — benchmark results

End-to-end criterion micro-benches comparing holt against
**RocksDB** (`rocksdb` crate, default-features-off + bundled
`librocksdb-sys`) and **SQLite** (`rusqlite` with the
`bundled` libsqlite3, so contributors don't need a system
SQLite installation). Three workload shapes (KV, S3
object-store metadata, POSIX filesystem metadata) ×
{ memory, persistent } × { get, put, mixed, list, list-delim }.

## Reproducing

```bash
# Full suite (~5 min on M3 Pro).
cargo bench --bench main -- --output-format bencher

# One group only — e.g. just KV.
cargo bench --bench main -- kv_ --output-format bencher

# Put-only scale curve refreshed for the current v0.3 branch.
cargo bench --bench main -- _scale_put --noplot --output-format bencher
```

Each criterion sample is one op. Numbers are mean ± noise band
in nanoseconds; lower is better. Holt's per-op numbers are
randomised over a 10 000-key dataset (see `gen_*_dataset`);
RocksDB / SQLite are driven by the same dataset for fair
comparison.

## Test environment

- **Hardware**: Apple M3 Pro (12 cores), 36 GB RAM
- **OS**: macOS 26.3 (Darwin 25.0.0)
- **Rust**: 1.94.0 stable, release profile (`lto=thin`,
  `codegen-units=1`, `opt-level=3`)
- **holt**: code commit `104ac23` for the refreshed scale-put
  tables (BlobNode child-entry removal + recursive cross-blob
  latch coupling). Older get/list tables are from the same M3 Pro
  benchmark track and should be refreshed before a release tag.
- **RocksDB**: 0.24 (`librocksdb-sys` 0.18, bundled)
- **SQLite**: rusqlite 0.39 (bundled libsqlite3)
- **Knob alignment**: all three engines use comparable
  "per-op durable to OS page cache, not fsync'd" semantics —
  see the durability matrix at the top of `benches/main.rs`.

## Headline numbers

24 baseline benches across KV / objstore / fs shapes, memory +
persistent variants at 20 k keys: **holt wins all 24** vs
RocksDB and SQLite. Margin range: 1.3× (in-memory fs_put vs
SQLite — both short codepaths) to **467×** (`fs_list_dir`
S3-style rollup vs RocksDB — fast-forward over `BlobNode`
crossings beats seek-iterator-per-leaf hands down).

The scale curve in Group B (below) extends this across
`{ 20 k, 100 k, 500 k, 2 M }` keys × three workload shapes
(scale-put tables refreshed on the current v0.3 branch; get
tables are from the earlier v0.3 M3 Pro run):

- **Get scales beautifully**: holt wins every get cell at every
  tier. The lead vs RocksDB widens to **5.4× / 2.8× / 2.2×** at
  2 M (kv / objstore / fs) as the LSM's read-amplification
  finally bites.
- **Put wins every point in the current scale-put run**: holt wins
  puts at every tier through 2 M. At 2 M: **1.24×** ahead of
  RocksDB on kv, **1.05×** ahead on objstore, and **1.01×** on
  fs. Treat the fs cell as effectively tied rather than a large
  win — the point estimate is ahead, but the margin is tiny.

## Note on `wal_sync_on_commit=true`

A previous draft tried to bench all three engines at the
"flip the strongest fsync knob" tier. The result wasn't a
fair comparison: each engine's "sync=true" knob actually
maps to a different syscall on macOS (`F_FULLFSYNC` vs
`F_BARRIERFSYNC` vs just `write()`+lazy-fsync), so we ended
up measuring drive-cache flush latency for some engines and
kernel-page-cache flushes for others. The numbers said more
about the platform than the engines, so that bench group was
removed. The numbers above (`*_persist_put`) are the honest
"per-op durable to OS page cache, not fsync'd" tier, which
all three engines actually do reach with comparable
semantics.

## Workload notes

- **`*_get` / `*_put`**: 10 000-key dataset, randomly sampled
  with `StdRng(seed=SEED)`. Pre-load happens once outside the
  measured region.
- **`*_mixed`**: 80 % gets, 20 % puts, same dataset.
- **`*_list`** (plain): prefix narrows to ~625 keys
  (`objstore`) / ~1 250 keys (`fs`); each criterion sample
  iterates up to 100 results.
- **`*_list_dir`** (S3-style rollup): prefix + delimiter `/`;
  emits 32 (`objstore`) / 16 (`fs`) `CommonPrefix` entries per
  pass, then stops. Holt's iterator's fast-forward — ascend
  past each rollup's subtree — turns the walk from
  `O(leaves_under_prefix)` into `O(distinct_rollups)`. RocksDB
  + SQLite both scan every leaf and dedupe in the host loop,
  which is what the 100–500× gap measures.

## Group B — Scale curve (20 k → 100 k → 500 k → 2 M keys)

Parameterized point lookup + upsert across **three workload
shapes × four dataset sizes**, so the comparison is not biased
by "everything fits in L2 cache" at 20 k. The 500 k tier (~48 MB)
already exceeds holt's default 32 MB (64-blob) buffer pool; the
**2 M tier (~192 MB) is 6× the pool**, so every miss pays the
full `read_blob` + cross-blob descent cost. This is the
working-set-cannot-be-held shape where engine behaviour diverges.

### Observations

#### Get path scales gracefully on all three workloads

Across kv / objstore / fs at every tier through 2 M keys, **holt
wins point lookup**. The lead vs RocksDB widens dramatically at
2 M because RocksDB's bloom filters start missing more often and
the read has to descend multiple SST levels:

| 2 M get  | Holt   | RocksDB | speedup |
| -------- | -----: | ------: | ------: |
| kv       | 1 015  | 5 509   |  5.4×   |
| objstore | 1 088  | 3 066   |  2.8×   |
| fs       | 1 105  | 2 382   |  2.2×   |

(The kv get speedup is largest because random 32-byte keys force
the worst LSM behaviour — no path locality, every read is a
fresh bloom probe. The path-key workloads still see a >2× lead
even though RocksDB's prefix compression in SSTs softens the
blow.) Holt's descent depth scales with `log(N)` of distinct
prefixes, not with SST level count, so it grows
**5.4× / 4.7× / 5.1×** across the 100× data growth (kv / objstore
/ fs) — far less than RocksDB's 8× / 4.8× / 3.6× for the same
range.

SQLite get tightens to 1.2-1.4× at 2 M because its B-tree handles
cache pressure gracefully — bounded fan-out + 64 MB page cache
keeps lookup depth dominated by index height, which grows slowly.

#### Put path: v0.3 close-out

v0.2.1 had an honest gap on 2 M path-shaped put: -13 % vs
RocksDB on objstore, -18 % vs RocksDB on fs. **The current v0.3
line closes that gap in this run**, although the 2 M fs cell is
best read as a tie rather than a meaningful win.

| 2 M put  | v0.2.1 | current v0.3 | Δ      | current v0.3 vs Rocks | vs SQLite |
| -------- | -----: | -----------: | -----: | --------------------: | --------: |
| kv       | 1 296  |        1 276 | -2 %   | **1.24×** ahead | 1.27× ahead |
| objstore | 1 503  |        1 463 | -3 %   | **1.05×** ahead | 1.06× ahead |
| fs       | 1 492  |        1 436 | -4 %   | 1.01× ahead / effectively tied | 1.06× ahead |

The root cause of the v0.2.1 gap was **API + walker constant-
factor overhead**, not the cross-blob descent cost we initially
attributed it to:

1. `Tree::put`'s `Result<Option<Vec<u8>>>` signature forced a
   per-op leaf-extent value read + clone on every same-key
   update, even though the bench never consumed the returned
   `Option`. RocksDB / SQLite's blind overwrite paid no
   equivalent cost.
2. `insert_into_prefix` allocated a `Vec` per Prefix descent to
   work around a borrow it didn't actually need (`Prefix` is
   `Copy`). Hot on path-shaped keys where Prefix chains are
   deep.
3. WAL `Insert.prev_value` was encoded as `Some(prev)` on every
   put even though replay never reads it; pure wire-format
   overhead.

v0.3.0 split `put` (blind, `Result<()>`) from `insert` (returning,
`Result<Option<Vec<u8>>>`); same for `delete` / `remove`. Blind
walker path skips the leaf-extent value read, drops the prefix
`.to_vec()`, and writes `Option::None` into the WAL `prev_value`
slot. All three are pure constant-factor wins (no algorithmic
change). The later cross-blob latch-coupling + `BlobNode`
format break removes the parent-held fallback path and the
child-entry repair work, which is what makes the final 2 M
path-shaped put cells no longer lose to RocksDB in this run.

**Adjacent v0.3 wins.** These scale-put benches exercise blind
`put` on a single op at a time. Several v0.3 changes matter more
for adjacent surfaces than for this exact table:

- **WAL format v3** (`Insert.prev_value` / `Erase.value` slots
  removed entirely). Bench writes are blind, so the v0.3.0 path
  already wrote `Option::None` for those slots — saving one
  presence byte per record. The full win lands on the *returning*
  `Tree::insert` / `Tree::remove` paths, which v0.3.0 still
  wrote `Some(prev)` for; the current v0.3 line doesn't write the
  prev value to the WAL at all (the walker hands it straight to
  the caller).
- **`Tree::get_with` zero-copy primitive.** `Tree::get` (the
  Vec-returning convenience this bench uses) is unchanged. Hot
  read paths that opt in to the callback skip the per-call
  `Vec<u8>` allocation + memcpy — sized at ~100-200 ns on the
  M3 Pro at 2 M, ~10-20 % of the total get latency.
- **`Tree::txn` batch encoder bypass.** Single-op writes are
  unaffected; multi-op batches skip per-op intermediate `Vec`
  clones that the v0.3.0 `wal_ops: Vec<TxnOp>` aggregator forced.
  Bench doesn't exercise `txn`.

The hard cell remains **`fs_scale_put` at 2 M**. The current
point estimate is slightly ahead of RocksDB, but the margin is
only ~1 %. This is still the regime where LSM write amortization
is most competitive: WAL append + memtable insert stay cheap
regardless of working-set size, while ART-over-blobs pays
cross-blob descent plus deeper Prefix chains on long POSIX
paths. Treat this as "closed to parity", not as a decisive write
win.

#### What this means in practice

- **Read-dominated metadata workloads at any scale**: holt wins
  cleanly across kv / objstore / fs / list / list_dir, with the
  lead widening at larger working sets (5.4× / 2.8× / 2.2× at
  2 M get).
- **Mixed workloads**: holt wins puts too at every tier in the
  current scale-put run. The caveat is 2 M fs put: it is
  effectively parity with RocksDB, not a large win. If your
  workload sits there with a heavy write skew, either size the
  holt buffer pool to hold the hot set, or use a write-optimized
  engine.

## Group C — p95 / p99 latency under maintenance interference

`tests/bench_contention_p95.rs` runs four `put` writers + a
background checkpointer (5 ms cadence) + a compaction thread
that periodically calls `tree.compact()` — the worst-case
"engine is doing maintenance while users keep writing"
shape. Every `put` records its wall-clock latency to a
`hdrhistogram` for percentile reporting.

```bash
cargo test --release --test bench_contention_p95 \
    -- --ignored --nocapture
```

### Result (20-second window, 4 writers + bg checkpoint + compact)

| Metric           | Value         |
| ---------------- | ------------: |
| ops              |   6 152 095   |
| throughput       |   306 918 ops/s |
| **mean**         |     12.79 µs  |
| **p50**          |      1.96 µs  |
| **p95**          |     28.54 µs  |
| **p99**          |    107.58 µs  |
| p99.9            |   2 310.14 µs |
| max              |  30 654.46 µs |

### Observations

- **307 k ops/s sustained** with 4 writer threads + a
  background checkpointer + concurrent `compact()`. Each
  writer averages ~77 k ops/s on its own, so the wal-lock
  serialization tax is modest.
- **p50 ≈ 2 µs** — most puts hit only the common "walker
  mutate + mark_dirty + wal.append + flush" critical section
  with no maintenance interference.
- **p99 ≈ 100 µs** — tail dominated by the wal.lock
  serialization point during checkpoint snapshots (rounds run
  every ~5 ms and briefly take the lock to drain dirty +
  pending_deletes + flush WAL).
- **p99.9 ≈ 2 ms** and **max ≈ 30 ms** — the spikes are
  `compact()` calls themselves (which take the wal.lock for
  the duration of phase 1 / 1.5 / 2 since `compact` is not
  yet online — see the docstring on `Tree::compact`). These
  bound the worst case under maintenance; the v0.3 maintenance
  latch will reduce them further by serializing compact
  against writers more cleanly.

The mean-vs-p50 gap (12.8 µs mean vs 2 µs p50) reflects that
the slow tail (compact calls hit a handful of writes hard) is
real but bounded — the distribution isn't long-tailed enough
to perturb the median.
